# pine.co
pine.co is a fun little project that I created in order to become more familiar with Laravel 5, as well as concepts such as handling users, sending emails, handling payments, creating a detailed database structure, and having all that work together without imploding.

## How To Install And Run (probably)

1. Run ```composer install```
2. Run ```php artisan migrate:refresh --seed```
3. Run ```php artisan serve```
4. Enjoy?
